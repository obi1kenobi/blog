Welcome to my blog! I'm a CS student at UC Santa Cruz interested in systems, programming languages, and how we can use these fields to remove entire classes of programming errors.  I also love open-source software and the communities surrounding it.  This summer, I'm super lucky to be a Google Summer of Code contributor on the Rust tool [cargo-semver-checks](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks), which helps library maintainers eliminate the class of errors of not adhering to semantic versioning guarantees.  Check out my [GSoC '24 intro](@/gsoc-24-intro.md) page for more info.

You can find me on GitHub [here](https://github.com/suaviloquence), and the source code for this blog is available [here](https://github.com/suaviloquence/blog).
